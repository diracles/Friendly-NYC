Friendly-NYC
============

Friendly NYC is a data storytelling project I completed for my Data Science final at ITP.  
In this project I wanted to figure what the friendliest neighborhood in New York is based 
of tips and reviews of venues in each neighborhood.  

After exploring the foursuqare API and not retrieving a sufficient amount of tips per venue I ended up querying the "google place" api for different words which relate to friendliness:  
friendly, amiable, loyal, sensitive, etc.

I then converted the json result to csv and plotted the locations to a google geo map using google fusion charts. The sample data set I built from the queries amounts to a tiny fraction of the venues in NYC but it does represent a true random sample.

The final answer turned out to be:  the West Village!
